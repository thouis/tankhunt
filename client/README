This is the README for the tankhunt client.
-------------------------------------------
Usage:    
tankhunt.client [-display display] [-server server] [-port port] [-name name]

display: where to display the client
server:  the machine the server is running on
port:    the port the server is listening to for connections on its machine
          (defaults to 3333)
name:    the 3 letter name you want displayed below your tank in the game
          (defaults to "non" for "noname")

The client will build bitmaps for each of the possible 256 rotations
of the tanks.  There will be some delay as it builds these and before
it contacts the server.


Controls
--------
Mouse controls:
Left mouse button:   Fire in the direction your tank is facing
Middle mouse button: Fire in the direction your tank is facing, then
                      turn towards the mouse
Left mouse button:   Turn towards the mouse

Keyboard controls:
0-9        : set your speed (server only supports speed of 8 by default)
)!@#$%^&*( : set your speed to the negative of the unshifted value of the key
              (ie. '%' = -5)
<          : set your speed to one speed slower
>          : set your speed to one speed higher
f          : same as left button
b          : same as middle button
k          : same as right button


Keymap
------
It is possible to make the client use a keymap stored in the
environment variable TANK_HUNT_MAP.  The format is character you want
to hit followed by action you want it to take from the table above.

For example:

tank% setenv TANK_HUNT_MAP ' 8e*'

maps space to '8' and 'e' to '*' ( negative 8)


How to play the game
--------------------
How the game is played will vary from server to server as improvements
and changes are made.  

In short: Kill or be killed.  You can only fire the way your tank is
facing.  Don't run into anything (tanks, walls, bullets, explosions).
Bullets are only stopped by walls, so don't fire straight down
infinite corridors.  Keep your arms and legs inside the tank at all
times.  Do not stand up.  Have fun.
